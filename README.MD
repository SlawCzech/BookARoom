# Lecture Room Booking System

This project is a simple tool for managing a number of rooms for education purposes.
After introducing the rooms to the database, you can manage their availability and search according to your needs.

However, please note that this is still a work in progress.

### It has the following functionalities:
- viewing status of all rooms
- adding and deleting rooms
- modifying rooms (like adding equipment)
- making reservations for specific dates
- searching for rooms meeting capacity and equipment expectations
- viewing reservations

### This to be fixed:
- bugs in the search engine
- viweing reservations
